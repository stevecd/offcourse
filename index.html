<a name="so" class="anchor" href="#so"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So...</h3>

<p>As a teacher forced to use oncoursesystems.com's lesson planner, have you ever diligently filled out
a full year of lessons?  Have you then had a few unplanned cancellations come through?  Maybe you had
a particularly intelligent class that flew through the material, or a slower class that lagged behind?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, you inevitably have come to this situation where you have to push or pull what's left of your lesson plan around.</p>

<p>This is the situation offCourse was made to fix.</p>

<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ol>
<li>Backup any number of lessons between two given dates.</li>
<li>Insert lessons into oncourse's lesson plan, pushing all following lessons back one day.  (shuffle)</li>
<li>More to come provided there's any demand, or I get frustrated enough with oncourse to add more :)</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="what-it-actually-does" class="anchor" href="#what-it-actually-does"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it actually does</h3>

<p>All this really does is fill up a job queue of all of the requests that you'd have to do to do the specific task yourself.  So, in the case of inserting a lesson what would you do?  You'd go to the last lesson that you care about in that year, click copy.  Move one day later and click paste, skipping weekends or holidays.  You'd repeat this over and over and... over until you got all the way back to the
lesson you want to push back.</p>

<p>offCourse simply fills up a queue of the requests you'd have to do to insert a day, and then fires those requests sequentially at as fast a rate as oncourse allows.</p>

<h3>
<a name="warning" class="anchor" href="#warning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WARNING</h3>

<p>Since this program is in no way affiliated with oncoursesystems, they can and will change the way their website works.  When this happens, offCourse will cease to function until an update is made.</p>

<p>Also, while oncourse does keep a revision history on your lesson plans, they do not keep track of changes to linked standards.  There is potential for data loss should something go wrong, and you should test on lessons you don't care about first.</p>
