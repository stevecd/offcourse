<h1 class="text-center">Backup Lessons</h1>
<p>This task will grab all of the lessons between two given dates and save them in JSON format.</p>
<p>Specifically it will grab the notes, homework, and linked standards of each lesson.</p>
<p>
  This is intended to prevent data loss from other tasks as you can keep a local backup of
  the range of dates you intend to change.
</p>
<p>
  A restore task may be added in the future if there's any demand.
  For now, JSON is a plain text format and you should be able to open backup files with
  any text editor or web browser and make sense of what's there.
