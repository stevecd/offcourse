          While Oncourse does keep a revision history of your lesson plans, it does not appear to keep track of linked standards.
          This task moves those around too, so there is potential for permanent data loss should something go wrong.

        <h3>Set Skipped Days</h3>
        <p>
          Click days on each calendar to designate weekdays that should be skipped when shuffling.
          These will be days that will not be moved or overwritten.
        </p>
        <p>Typically one would want to mark all weekdays where there is no school.</p>
        <p>Ex: If Jan. 2nd is marked, the lesson on Jan. 1st will be moved to Jan. 3rd, leaving Jan. 2nd as it was. </p>
        <p>You can optionally save/load your marked skip days for future runs of this task.</p>

          Clicking the "Do it." button will launch this task.  Be absolutely sure you've backed up any data you wish to
          not lose.  If you're uncertain, it is suggested you test this task on a random test-lesson that you created on oncourse.
          The task does not delete the targetDate, so once it's finished, you'll see that the target date has just been copied to
          the date after it, but every lesson after that will have been moved a day later too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you wish to cancel the sequence in action, just close this program.  The task will be interrupted wherever it's at
          and no further changes will be made to your lesson plan.
