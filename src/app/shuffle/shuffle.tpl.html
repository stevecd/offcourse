          While Oncourse does keep a revision history of your lesson plans, it does not appear to keep track of linked standards.
          This task moves those around too, so there is potential for permanent data loss should something go wrong.

    <wz-step wz-title="Set Boundaries">
        <h3>Set Year Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Pick the start date and end date for the year in which you're shuffling lessons.</p>
        <p>It will be assumed that dates immediately before and after these dates are not important.</p>
        <p>The first blank lesson after the end-of-year date will mark the end of the year.</p>
        <p>
          To insert (n) blank lessons, offCourse will start at the final lesson, pushing everything over (n) weekday(s)
          until it gets to the insertion point.

    <wz-step wz-title="Set Skips">
        <h3>Set Skipped Days</h3>
        <p>Click days on each calendar to designate weekdays that should be skipped when shuffling.</p>
        <p>These will be days that will not be moved or overwritten.</p>
        <p>Typically one would want to mark all weekdays where there is no school.</p>
        <p>Ex: If January 2nd is marked and offCourse is moving the lesson on January 1st over one day,
          it will move that lesson to January 3rd, leaving January 2nd as it was.</p>
